# Sri Lanka Train Timetable - Next.js 13 (App Router)

This is a modern, static train timetable website built with **Next.js 13 (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** (no TypeScript).  
The site is static-ready and uses a local JSON file (`public/data/trains.json`) as the data source.

## Features
- Hero landing page with imagery
- Search form (date, time, from/to station, validation)
- Results displayed as cards with expandable stops
- Responsive, accessible design with Tailwind CSS
- SEO metadata and sitemap generation stub
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- All train data in `public/data/trains.json`

## Local development
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Replace images in `public/images` with higher-resolution photos for production.
- The project is intentionally JavaScript-only and App Router based.
